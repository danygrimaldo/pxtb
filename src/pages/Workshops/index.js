            <i>Introducing the Annie Sloan Method</i>
          </p>
          This is a beginner/intermediate workshop taught by a certified Annie
          Sloan Chalk Paint instructor. You'll learn several hands-on-painting
          techniques, along with the proper application of waxes and gilding
          wax. Bring yourself (or a girlfriend or two), everything else is
          provided! By attending the workshop you'll also receive 15% off any
          paint or paint accessories you purchase the end of the class.

          Complete an entire piece during our workshop and learn techniques
          along the way! Bring your own small piece (small enough to fit in the
          passenger side of your car and you can easily carry like a small side
          table). Purchase your paint and wax at a 15% discount the day of the
          class, you may use our workshop brushes.
