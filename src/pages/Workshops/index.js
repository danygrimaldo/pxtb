        Complete an entire piece during our workshop and learn techniques along
        the way! Bring your own small piece (small enough to fit in the
        passenger side of your car and you can easily carry like a small side
        table). Purchase your paint and wax at a 15% discount the day of the
        class, you may use our workshop brushes.
